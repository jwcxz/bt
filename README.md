bt
==

bt is a hardware beatracker and tempo estimator that probabilistically tries to
match a live input stream to one of many phase-locking metronomes.

For details on the project, check out my 
[blog post](http://blog.jwcxz.com/?p=1056) and 
[project proposal](http://jwcxz.com/projects/bt/proposal.pdf).
